Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns and play against each other on a 3x3 grid until there is a winner or the game ends in a tie.

How to Play
Setup: Open the game in your web browser. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.

Players: The game allows two players to play, X and O. Player X always goes first.

Gameplay: Players take turns clicking on an empty square on the board to place their symbol (X or O) in that position. Once a symbol is placed, it cannot be changed.

Winning: The game checks after each move if a player has won the game. If a player has three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game.

Tie: If all squares on the board are filled, and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.

Restart: After the game ends (either with a win or a tie), you can click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

Sound Effects
The game includes sound effects for various interactions:

Clicking a square will produce a "click" sound.
When X wins, a "winner" sound will play.
When O wins, a different "winner" sound will play.
In case of a tie, a "tie" sound will play.
